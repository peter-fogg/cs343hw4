\item To begin a TCP connection, the client sends a SYN message to the server. The server acknowledges with a SYN-ACK, which is received by the client, who then responds with an ACK. This is known as the three-way handshake. To create a SYN flood, the attacking client sends SYN packets but never responds to the SYN-ACK. The server will wait for the ACK, using some resources to maintain state. With enough SYN messages, the server runs out of resources -- in particular, it must maintain the state of each connection in the SYN queue. Once this queue is filled by the half-open connections to the attacker, the server cannot serve new (legitimate) requests.
